        HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MILLY!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚
        
        IT IS I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS, HERE TO WISH YOU THE MOST SPECTACULAR, MOST AMAZING BIRTHDAY EVER!!! OF COURSE, NO ONE ELSE COULD WISH YOU A BETTER BIRTHDAY THAN ME, BECAUSE I AM THE GREATEST AT EVERYTHINGâ€”ESPECIALLY BIRTHDAY WISHES!!!
        
        TODAY, YOU MUST CELEBRATE LIKE A TRUE COOL PERSON! EAT PLENTY OF SPAGHETTI (MY PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION), DANCE AROUND LIKE YOUâ€™RE FIGHTING IN A COOL BATTLE, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE TONS OF FUN!!!
        I WOULD HAVE MADE YOU A BIRTHDAY CAKE, BUT UNFORTUNATELYâ€¦ I GOT DISTRACTED PERFECTING MY LATEST SPAGHETTI RECIPE! NEXT YEAR, THOUGH, I WILL BAKE YOU THE GREATEST BIRTHDAY CAKE IN ALL OF THE UNDERGROUND!!!
