        Happy Birthday, deary Milly! 🍰🕷️
        
        I couldn’t let such a sweet occasion pass without sending my warmest wishes. After all, birthdays are like a lovely tea party—best enjoyed with plenty of cake, friends, and just the right amount of... intrigue. Ahuhuhu~!
        
        I hope your special day is filled with all the delicious treats you love, perhaps a cup of spider tea? Or maybe a slice of spider-cake? No? Well, I suppose something less… spidery will do. Either way, may you be wrapped in happiness all day long, deary!
        
        Remember, every thread of your life is woven with care, and today, your web sparkles a little brighter.
        
        Ahuhuhu~! Enjoy every moment!
        With sweet wishes and a web full of love,
        Muffet 🕸️
