    <p>Woof Woof!

        You see a small, white dog holding a piece of paper.
        It drops the paper at your feet. You pick it up and read…
        
        HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MILLY!!! 🎂🐾
        
        The Annoying Dog has heard it's your special day. But before it can say anything else…
        The dog runs off, stealing your birthday cake. 🍰💨
        
        (Whoops.)
        
        It drops a note as it escapes:
        
        "Don't worry, you'll get your cake back... probably. Maybe. But for now, just know this: You're awesome, and you deserve all the fun and happiness in the world today! The dog is rooting for you (while also planning its next mischief)."
        
        The Annoying Dog looks at you, wags its tail, and disappears into the void...
        
        Woof.
