    <p>Dear Milly,

        How the time flies… Another year has passed, and yet, you continue to grow into a truly remarkable person. On this special day, I want to wish you a birthday filled with joy, peace, and warmth—just like the kindness you carry in your heart.
        
        I hope today is full of smiles, laughter, and sweet moments shared with those dear to you. You deserve nothing less. Remember, no matter where life leads you, you have the strength to face any challenge, and the heart to bring light to even the darkest of times.
        
        Take care of yourself, and know that you are cherished—today and every day.
        
        With all my best wishes,
        Asgore Dreemurr
